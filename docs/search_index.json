For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid. allele_appearance(data, g_group, allele_db) Group alignment Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences. v_calls &lt;- unique(data[grepl(g_group,v_gene),v_call]) seq_align(v_calls, allele_db, vgerms, chain, mat, g_group) ## Scale for &#39;y&#39; is already present.

For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on. tmp_allele_db &lt;- allele_db %&gt;% dplyr::filter(grepl(as.character(g_group), new_allele)) %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(new_allele) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(or_allele = paste0(or_allele, collapse = &quot;/&quot;)) or_allele &lt;- setNames(gsub(chain, &quot;&quot;, as.character(tmp_allele_db$or_allele)), as.character(gsub( paste0(g_group, &quot;[*]&quot;), &quot;&quot;, tmp_allele_db$new_allele ))) allele_thresh = 0.5 tmp &lt;- data_cutoff(data, func_g_groups, g_group, allele_thresh, or_allele) With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 3 zygousity states. #scroll-box { overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x: scroll !important; } Observations This section is editable by clicking on the edit button below.
