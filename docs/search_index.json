For all projects the following filtration criteria were applied: Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts. Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene. Sequences which didn’t have gaps open (-) and didn’t include any N’s After changing into group annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove. For the non naive datasets only IGM/IGD sequences were taken and the V region was filtered to up to 3 mutations. The groups were created with similarity of 95% based on complete linkage and functional sequences and up to position 318. Groups Repertoire normalization The current groups threshold and the possible states are in the table below. Going over the groups showed several thins We saw potential duplication events, such as in the case of IGHV1-69*04 in sample P1_I50 from group G8, where we think this allele might be sitting in the duplicated gene. An interesting event involving a duplicated gene is in the case of IGHV3-43D from group G22. In this group 5 alleles are present, where three alleles are supposedly from the duplicated gene. Allele D*04 and D*04_G4A goes in states two with allele 01, in the J6 heterozygous samples we saw a double single chromosome deletion event. This occurred in 7 individuals and raises the question if maybe both alleles are sitting in the same location on the chromosome and are not acutely deleted. Group 19 and genes IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-23D, showed a very low usage for the D gene. From the usage results, we suspect that the gene in IGHV3-35G21 might be a pseudo gene. We saw several signle chromosome deletion events in gene V3-66 from the group G25, which also has the gene V3-53. In the group IGHV3-64G27, we suspect that allele 3-64*02 might be a pseudo allele due to very low usage. In group G34 there are only two states, and include two genes. In state one only an allele from V4-30-2 appears. While in state 2, one allele V4-30-2 and one from V4-30-4 appears. In group G48 there is a novel allele V6-1*01_T91C. This allele only appears in state 2 and is lowly expressed, much more when the max mutation value is 0. Based on the threshold we compared the alleles present in IMGT versus those that passed the threshold. We plotted the relative repertoire plotted. Each dot is an individual and the colors shows the zygousity state while the shape indicates the project.
