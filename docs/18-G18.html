<h2>Allele appearnce</h2>
<p>The group of IGHV3-21 includes 13 alleles, 13 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>

<h2>Absolute cutoff</h2>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 3 zygousity states.</p>
