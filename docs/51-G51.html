<h2>Allele appearnce</h2>
<p>The group of IGHV7-4-1 includes 6 alleles, 6 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>

<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
